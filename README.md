# English to Persian Translation using Encoder-Decoder Architecture

This project implements a deep learning model for translating English sentences into Persian using an Encoder-Decoder architecture. The Encoder-Decoder model has gained popularity in machine translation tasks due to its effectiveness in capturing semantic information from input sequences and generating corresponding output sequences.

## Features:
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** Utilizes an encoder to process input English sentences and a decoder to generate corresponding Persian translations.
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Learning:** Implements sequence-to-sequence learning paradigm, enabling the model to handle variable-length input and output sequences.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Incorporates attention mechanism to help the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during the translation process, enhancing the model's translation quality.
- **Bidirectional LSTM:** Employs bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units in the encoder to capture both past and future context of input sequences, enabling better representation learning.
- **Beam Search Decoding:** Implements beam search decoding technique to explore multiple translation hypotheses and generate more accurate translations.
- **Training and Inference Modes:** Supports both training mode for training the model on a dataset of English-Persian sentence pairs, and inference mode for translating English sentences into Persian.
